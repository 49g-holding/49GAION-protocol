# Library cards of 49GAION capabilities

Part cards and bot identity cards for the **AION Builder** (the 49GAION capability that builds `[ORG]AION` products, Standard §1.2 and §1.3) and for the **Self-Improvement AIOC** that carries out Self-Improvement inside `[ORG]HOAC-TM` (Standard §2.1). Protocol §10 requires a card for every part.

| Card | Schema | Test |
|---|---|---|
| `aion-builder.part-card.json` | `spec/schemas/part-card.schema.json` | TEST-AION-BUILDER v2: from a fixed sample intake, builds an `[ORG]AION` record that validates against `org-aion-record.schema.json`, with Standard, Protocol and Library versions recorded separately, a Library harvest list and a delivery test result, and touches no live system |
| `org-aion-self-improvement.part-card.json` | `spec/schemas/part-card.schema.json` | TEST-ORG-AION-SI v2: given a failing sample, opens a pull request (never merges) whose change makes the sample pass and re-runs every affected test |
| `aion-builder.bot-identity-card.json` | `spec/schemas/bot-identity-card.schema.json` | the same tests |
| `org-aion-self-improvement.bot-identity-card.json` | `spec/schemas/bot-identity-card.schema.json` | the same tests |

Each card is `DRAFT` until its test has run once with recorded evidence; no card here has that evidence yet. All four cards are validated by `tests/cards/check_cards.py`.
